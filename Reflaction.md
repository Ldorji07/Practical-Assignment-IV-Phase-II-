Documentation 
Main Concepts Applied:
In creating this portfolio website, I used several key web development concepts. I employed HTML to structure the content, with sections
like header, projects, services, about, and contact clearly defined to improve accessibility and readability. CSS was used extensively for 
styling, including animations and gradients to create a visually appealing layout. I used media queries to ensure the site is responsive and 
optimized for different screen sizes, enhancing the user experience across devices.

New Skills/Knowledge Acquired:
While working on this project, I gained a deeper understanding of CSS animations, such as fade-in effects and background pulsing animations.

Reflection
What I Learned:
I learned to integrate HTML, CSS, and animations effectively, improving my abilities in layout design and responsiveness. Troubleshooting 
image scaling and layout issues deepened my CSS knowledge.

Challenges:
Balancing layout and animations was challenging. Adjusting image sizes and animations for smoothness on all screens required multiple 
refinements, but improved the user experience.

Clarity & Coherence
The documentation is structured to be concise and clear, covering the project essentials in an organized format.
